## Files

I have added the design files in the following formats:

 - 3mf - For use in 3D Printing slicers
 - f3d - For import into Fusion 360
 - step - For import in other CAD software

## Printing Details

- You will need to print two of them.
- No supports are needed

## Additional Hardware Required

- CNC Kitchen M3x3 inserts, available here: [CNC Kitchen](https://cnckitchen.store/products/gewindeeinsatz-threaded-insert-m3-short-100-stk-pcs) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/KITCHEN-Original-Threaded-Insert-Version/dp/B09FXNX6WF)
- 4x M3 bolts, length 6-10mm.
- (Optional) A right angle micro USB cable - The CYD can be mounted on stand with the USB cable pointing up, or down. If you point it down, you maybe need to get a right angle cable. The ideal one would be [something like this](https://amzn.to/3rfJXnV) (the retention clips side of the micros USB is on the same side as the cable) 

Instructions for using the inserts [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-UF4tv3Hvc&t=368s).
