## Simple CYD stand leg - Portrait

This is a very simple design that is easy and quick to print for holding your CYD up in portrait. 

### Printing Details

- You will need to print two of them.
- Supports are needed
- You can increase the layer height on this with very little practical impact (I used 0.28mm layer height and the print took just under and hour for 1)

### Additional Hardware Required

- 4no. M3 bolt - length is not really important. Shorter than ~20mm will still be contained the plastic.
- (Optional) A right angle micro USB cable - The CYD can be mounted on stand with the USB cable pointing up, or down. If you point it down, you maybe need to get a right angle cable. The ideal one would be [something like this](https://amzn.to/3rfJXnV) (the retention clips side of the micros USB is on the same side as the cable)
