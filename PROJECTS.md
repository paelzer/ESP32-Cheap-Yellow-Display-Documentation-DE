# Projects

Because the CYD is a common platform, it makes it really useful for sharing projects. This page will be a list of projects that are available on the CYD.

## Disclamer!

Projects appearing on here is not necessarily a seal of approval from me, I will not be test each project that gets added, so please install these projects at your own risk!
